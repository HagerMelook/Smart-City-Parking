# Overview of the Smart City Parking Management System
The Smart City Parking Management System is a comprehensive solution designed to optimize urban parking by connecting parking lots, meters, and drivers through a centralized database. It aims to efficiently manage parking availability, reservations, pricing, and traffic flow, offering real-time updates. The system uses IoT-style interactions to monitor parking spots and share this data with users, providing a more organized, accessible, and user-friendly parking experience.
# Goals of the System
- Real-Time Availability: Track and display the availability of parking spots in real-time across multiple locations.
- Dynamic Pricing: Implement a dynamic pricing model that adjusts parking rates based on time of day, and location of the lot.
- User Reservations: Allow drivers to reserve parking spots in advance, with penalties for not using reserved spots.
- Role-Based Access: Differentiate access levels for regular users (drivers), parking lot administrators, and system administrators.
- Web Integration: Provide a web-based interface for users to search, reserve, and navigate to available parking spots.
# Technology
- Database Management: Use MySQL for handling parking data with triggers, stored procedures, and constraints to ensure data consistency and avoid double bookings.
- Web Interface: Utilize Java or Spring Boot for the back-end, combined with Angular or React for the front-end to create a responsive, user-friendly interface.
- REST API: Develop an API to integrate with web applications, enabling real-time data exchange and reservations.
- IoT Simulation: Simulate IoT sensors using Python or similar tools to periodically update parking spot statuses (available or occupied).
- Performance Testing: Use tools like Apache JMeter or Gatling for load testing to ensure the system performs well under varying user loads.
- Reporting Tools: Implement Jasper or similar tools for generating detailed reports on parking lot performance, occupancy, and user statistics.
